# autocomplete

Super baby autocomplete suggestions, using super baby prefix tries. If at first you don't succeed on an interview question, go home and implement a way cooler version.

## Running

Install [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/), then `cd` into the cloned repository and run:

```
$ cargo run
```

`main.rs` loads and searches the CSV of Wikipedia titles, but you could substitute any file.
