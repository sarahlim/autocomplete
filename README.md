# autocomplete

Rust toys! Also known as: if at first you don't succeed on an interview question, go home and implement a way cooler version.

- `trie.rs`: Super baby prefix trie implementation.
- `main.rs`: Autocomplete suggestions, using prefix tries. 
- `boggle.rs`: Boggle solver, using prefix tries.

## Running

Install [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/), then `cd` into the cloned repository and run:

```
$ cargo run
```

to start the autocompleter (which loads and searches the CSV of Wikipedia titles).
